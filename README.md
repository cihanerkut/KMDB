Kurzchalia Microarray Database (KMDB) is a visualization tool for the DNA microarray data collected by the Kurzchalia Group at
Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics (MPI-CBG) in Dresden. It is hosted internally on MPI-CBG servers.
This repo contains only the R source code that is under development, not the actual microarray data.
